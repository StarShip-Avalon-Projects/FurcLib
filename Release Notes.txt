Bug Report #8 Implimented Suggestions
1.] Change the down arrow on each area to an x. The x would be more comprehensive.
2.] When a user closes the last open area, create a new area so that there is always an area on screen.
6.] Add ability to delete columns. You already make it easy to add columns, why not delete too?
7.] Add a prompt to ask the user if they're sure they want to delete a table or column.
8.] When adding a table, if the user presses ENTER or RETURN, press the OK button for them.
**12.] Add a way to auto-update the database. When I added a column using an ALTER TABLE SQL statement, I did not see my new column until I reopened the database.
*14.] Instead of throwing an error that allows the user to close out the entire program just because of a small typo or something in their query, have the error report return back to the program instead unless its a program-crashing bug.
15.] When an SQL statement, that isn't a SELECT statement executes correctly, display a message of some sort to notify the user of this.
16.] When opening a table, do NOT overwrite the area that they currently have open. Instead, open a new area so the individual doesn't lose their queries.

*Started Implimentation, Need more insight to whaat to do as the Application has been crashing for legit reasons related to this.
** Do you mean auto execute SELECT * FROM [table] when executing SQLTextBox or when the AddColumn popup is used?
