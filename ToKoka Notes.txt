Ok I yeild to your pro exp.. You mentioned at install Look for Furc path which the app will read from?
I had a few different ideas for it.
The first idea is let the user set where their furcadia directory is.
this Versions 2.18.x now... Because I'm adding in the PS Level Bot/Dream settings...
The second idea was to program VB or C# to get a list of the drives on the computer, and then search within those drives the usual paths of Furcadia. Should that fail, allow the user to resort to first idea.
I know its possible because we do that with our programs here where I work.
Oh Kinda like Furcs Config tool?
Yeah
You also would have to consider if someone has Furcadia installed on a thumbdrive instead.
The third idea, which can help the other two, is have the program look at its own installation folder's drive first to check if a path to furcadia can be found on that drive.
The whole registry thing.. I can see how it'd work but when you get multiple computers involved, their registries may be different and might not even contain the values you're looking for.
My computer is a prime example.
